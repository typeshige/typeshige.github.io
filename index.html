<h1>395 Remodel</h1>
<h4>Created: June 22, 2019</h4>

<h2>Existing Floor Plan</h2>
<img src="395-existing.png">

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>First floor only. Second floor is not included here since there are no changes.</li>
<li>Drawn to scale and generally correct. Layout missing a few details in the hallway.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposed Floor Plan<h2>
<p>The 6 room house is converted to a 5 room with a lot of cool (in my opinion) features.</p>

<img src="395-proposed.png">

<p>These are my original ideas with all the features I was hoping to have.</p>

<h3>Genkan (玄関)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Japanese-inspired entryway genkan (玄関) adds a small room with a new front door.  The existing front door area is widened. I'm not totally sure 
where the new front door should be.  I was also hoping to make it outswinging so it doesn't cut into the interior space.  This space was also supposed 
to be one step lower than the living room.  The idea is to put a bench and place to put shoes, umbrellas and coats.  There is a different door for the 
garage entry that doesn't interfere with the front door.  People coming in from the garage also enter into the genkan to remove shoes before entering the
living room.</li>

</div>

</ul>
<h3>Garage</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the garage, a tankless water heater replaces the existing tank. The closet/shoe box uses some space in the garage that used to contain the washer
and dryer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Living Room</h3>
<ul>
<li>The living room is mostly unchanged.  It'll add a ceiling fan and LED can lights.  Note the openings are changed and wider.  The exit opening is where
the front door is now.  It's widened a bit.  The opening to the kitchen is shifted about a foot and widened to make it more inviting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kitchen</h3>
<ul>
<li>The kitchen has a bank of cabinets and a new design.  I have a revised design that's is added below.</li>
<li>The dotted line in the kitchen is where the ceiling is raised from 8 foot to 9.  I wanted to keep the parameter with 8 foot to fit plumbing, DWV and 
HVAC.</li>

<li>Here are some rough 3d sketches of the kitchen.  It has the induction range where the window is, but perhaps it's better to put it on the island? 
The fridge, sink and range make good kitchen triangle. The sketch makes it look like the wall is open to the living room but it's not. The counter 
space next to the refrigerator is for tucking away appliances.</li>

<p>An example of a stove right next to a window, but now that I think about it, it won't work well with the windows I have.  Let's swap and put the sink
back in front of the window.</p>
</div>

<li>Maybe the double oven with microwave and steam oven is a bit excessive.</li>
<li>Note the wider opening to the kitchen with the bank of cabinets (for the pantry.)
</ul>
<h3>Stairs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is it worth re-doing so it's a more open and not totally enclosed as it is now?</li>
<li>The space under the stairs can be used as storage. Some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Just a simple door with shelves as another pantry.</li>
<li>A custom pull-out unit that has lots of storage.</li>
<li>Just an open space for fancy bikes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Master Bed Room</h3>
<ul>
<li>This was made more square by moving the wall back into the space occupied by the adjacent bedroom and pulling back the wall where the old closets 
were. That bedroom was totally sacrified and the remaining area is now a walk-in closet and laundry space.  NOTE: If we think this doable, we 
must stop the stucco work at the brown coat stage so we can remove the existing window and close it up.  Otherwise, the final coat won't be seamless.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Master Bed En Suite</h3>
<ul>
<li>This was made bigger by using space that used to be part of the original closet. It has a Japanese design where half is the sink and toilet and 
back part is a shower and soaking tub.</li>

</div>

</ul>
<h3>Full bath</h3>
<ul>
<li>The depth has been reduced to give more space to the en suite, but with width was increased by using space from the master bedroom.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laundry Space</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the hallway is a new space for the washer and dryer.  It has a sliding (or bifold) with some storage for supplies.</li>
</ul>
